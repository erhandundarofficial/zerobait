# Zerobait

Zerobait is a B2C phishing detection and education platform. Users can:

- Check URLs for potential phishing threats.
- Learn to recognize phishing via mini-games and short courses.
- Earn scores and compete on a global leaderboard.
- Report suspicious URLs to help protect other users.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` – React + Tailwind web app (URL scanner, games, leaderboard).
- `backend/` – Node.js + Express API (auth, URL scanning, games, leaderboard, DB access).
- `memory-bank/` – Long-term project documentation and context.

## Getting Started (Planned)

Detailed setup instructions (Docker, Postgres, Prisma, frontend/backend dev) will be added as Phase 0 progresses. Refer to `memory-bank/` for design and architecture decisions.
